-<li> One catch is that the X11 Type 1 font library has a rather low limit
-  on the font size. Because of this the fonts with  more complicated
-  outlines and the enabled hint substitution may not fit into
-  this limit. The same applies to the fonts with very complicated
-  outlines or with very many glyphs (especially the fonts with
-  over 256 glyphs). So you will need to excercise caution with
-  these options if you plan using these fonts with X11. Some vendors 
-  such as HP provide the Type 1 implementation licensed from Adobe 
-  which should have no such problem.
-<p>
-
-  But there is a solution even for the generic X11. A patch located
-  in the subdirectory `<tt>app/X11</tt>' fixes this problem as well
-  as some other minor problems. Its description is provided in
-  <A HREF="app/X11/README.html">app/X11/README</A>.
-<p>
-
-  To fix the X11 font library, you have to get the X11 sources. I
-  can recommend the ftp sites of the XFree86 project <A HREF="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org">ftp://ftp.xfree86.org</A>
-  or of the Open Group <A HREF="ftp://ftp.x.org">ftp://ftp.x.org</A>. This patch was made on the sources
-  of XFree86 so you may have better success with applying it to the
-  XFree86 distribution. After you have got the sources, make sure
-  that you can compile them. Then apply the patch as described.
-  Make sure that it was applied properly. Compile the sources again
-  (actually, you need only the fonts library, the fonts server, and
-  possibly the X server). It would be prudent now to save your old
-  font library, font server and, possibly, X server. Then install
-  the new recently compiled versions of these files. Of course,
-  if you know someone who already has compiled these files for the
-  same OS as yours, you can just copy the binary fles from him.
-<p>
-
-  Alas, building the X11 system from the source code is not the
-  easiest thing in the world and if you have no experience it
-  can be quite difficult. In this case just avoid the aforementioned
-  features or check each converted font to make sure that it
-  works properly.
-<p>
-
-<li> The Type1 font library from the standard X11 distribution
-  does not work on HP-UX (at least, up to 10.01). The font server
-  supplied with HP-UX up to 10.01 is also broken. Starting from 
-  HP-UX 10.20 (I don't know about 10.10) they supply a proprietary font

-<b>Ttf2pt1</b> can be built on Windows either with native compiler or in
-POSIX emulation mode.
-<p>
-
-Native MS Windows compilers require a different way to build the converter 
-instead of the Makefile (their <tt>make</tt> programs commonly are quite weird
-and limited in capabilities). An example of batch file <tt>winbuild.bat</tt> 
-is provided for MS Visual C/C++. Probably it can be easily adapted for other 
-32-bit Windows and DOS compilers. The important part is to define the 
-preprocessor symbol WINDOWS during compilation.
-<p>
-
-Cygnus <tt>make</tt> almost supports full Makefiles but not quite. Seems
-like its POSIX support is also of the same quality "almost but not quite".
-So another command file <tt>cygbuild.sh</tt> is provided for Cygnus GNU C, also 
-with the preprocessor symbol WINDOWS defined. It is intended to be run from
-the Cygnus BASH shell. To run the programs produced by the Cygnus compiler 
-the Cygnus library file <tt>CYGWIN1.DLL</tt> should be copied first into 
-<tt>C:\WINDOWS</tt>.
-<p>
-
-To run the accompanying scripts Perl for Windows will be required as well as 
-other tools from the Cygnus set.

-
-The Windows support was not particularly tested, so in case of problems with
-building or running the converter please let us know.

-Basically, the biggest problem with Netscape Navigator is that
-it has built-in fixed PostScript font names and built-in fixed 
-glyph tables for them. Oh, no, that's two! Let's start over: 
-basically the two biggest problems of Netscape Navigator are 
-that (one)it has built-in fixed PostScript font names and (two)
-built-in fixed glyph tables for them and (three) it always
-assumes that the fonts have ISOLatin1 encoding. OK, let's
-start over again: basically the three biggest problems of Netscape 
-Navigator are that (one) it has built-in fixed PostScript font names, 
-(two) built-in fixed glyph tables for them and (three) it always
-assumes that the fonts have ISOLatin1 encoding and (four) it
-does not remember the scaled font size between the sessions.

-If you use TrueType fonts in your X, as I do, and you always get
-KOI8-R encoded pages, then your Netscape does not recognise windows-1251
-encoding.  Microsoft TrueType fonts simply declare all encodings they
-can support including KOI8-R.  For some reason, KOI8-R always wins over
-ISO-8859-5 in Netscape under X.  If you are reading other cyrillic
-languages besides Russian, you might want to either erase KOI8-R entries
-from the fonts.dir and fonts.scale files, or alternatively fix Netscape.
-I put this line in my .Xdefaults.

-    Netscape*documentFonts.charset*koi8-r:               iso-8859-5

-Notice that you can still read Russian sites without trouble because
-Netscape translates KOI8-R to ISO-8859-5 on the fly. I read both Russian
-and Serbian sites with no trouble.
