Subject: [PATCH] Fix unicode character printing (#112)

* Fix unicode character printing

Fix several issues that prevented it from working

  * link to the wide-character version of ncurses
  * define NCURSES_WIDECHAR
  * use a function that can print wide characters
  * fix the character range. I don't know what the original was supposed
    to be, but half-width kana (which is what the movie reportedly used)
    was not at that range.

* Fix half-width kana character range

I'm not very familiar with katakana, but I think the extra characters I
was using are punctuation or other marks. So let's remove them. Note
that this is the same range space-pagan is using.

(cherry picked from commit 7647b4774c72a0803b36d89ece4edd95f5dbb97f)
